I would like to have a setup script system similar to the upload files. The issue I am running into is that is does not work.
for the most part, everything gets up and running but there are still some glitches
1. I would like php memory to be 1G
2. FFmpeg needs to be installed
3. there needs to be a way to diagnose and correct nextcloud errors
4. when I try to setup different configurations, I get errors about the container not being present even though I can see it in my podman
5. I need to be able to setup selfsigned ssl
6. I would like all other options included in the script to work
